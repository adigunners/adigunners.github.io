## 2025-01-15: Architecture Decision - Static Site + Apps Script

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use hybrid architecture: Static frontend (GitHub Pages) + Google Apps Script backend for FPL league management system.

### Context

Need reliable, low-cost solution for managing FPL league with real money (₹162,000 prize pool) and 54 active participants. Must handle:

- Daily score processing from FPL API
- Automated prize calculations
- Email campaign management
- Live website updates

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Full Stack Web App** (Node.js + PostgreSQL)
   - Pros: Complete control, scalable
   - Cons: Higher cost, more complex deployment, maintenance overhead

2. **WordPress + Plugins**
   - Pros: Quick setup, many plugins available
   - Cons: Security concerns, limited customization, hosting costs

3. **Hybrid Static + Apps Script** (CHOSEN)
   - Pros: Free hosting, reliable, native Google services integration
   - Cons: Limited to Google ecosystem, Apps Script execution limits

### Rationale

- **Cost Efficiency**: $0/month operating costs vs $50-200/month for full stack
- **Reliability**: GitHub Pages 99.9% uptime SLA, Google Apps Script proven reliability
- **Simplicity**: Team can focus on features vs infrastructure management
- **Integration**: Native Google Sheets integration perfect for financial tracking
- **Proven Scale**: Successfully handles 54 users with ₹162,000 financial responsibility

## 2025-08-20: Code Architecture - Modular Component System

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Development Team

### Decision

Implement fully modular CSS/JavaScript architecture to eliminate code duplication and improve maintainability.

### Context

- Original monolithic files: 2000+ lines per HTML file
- Significant code duplication between index.html and winners.html
- Maintenance becoming difficult with inline styles and scripts
- Need professional development practices for team learning

### Implementation

**CSS Modularization**: 15 specialized files

- `variables.css` - Design tokens and theming
- `base.css` - Foundation styles
- `responsive.css` - Responsive design patterns
- `mobile-optimizations.css` - Mobile-first enhancements

**JavaScript Modularization**: 10+ modules

- `utils.js` - Shared utility functions
- `data-loader.js` - API integration and caching
- `countdown.js` - Deadline countdown system
- `ui-manager.js` - User interface management

### Results Achieved

- **Code Deduplication**: 85% reduction in duplicated code
- **File Size Reduction**: 2000+ lines → ~200 lines per HTML file
- **Maintainability**: Edit single module vs massive files
- **Performance**: Parallel loading, browser caching, faster load times
- **Team Learning**: Professional development practices adopted

### Rationale

Investment in proper architecture pays dividends in:

- Faster feature development
- Easier debugging and testing
- Better team collaboration
- Preparation for multi-league scaling

## 2024-12-01: Data Decision - Google Sheets as Primary Database

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted (with future migration path)
**Category:** Data Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

Use Google Sheets as primary database for league management with clear migration strategy for multi-league scaling.

### Context

**Single League Requirements**:

- 54 players maximum
- Simple relational data (players, scores, prizes)
- Financial transparency needs
- Non-technical stakeholder access for auditing

**Google Sheets Advantages**:

- Native Apps Script integration
- Built-in collaboration and sharing
- Familiar interface for non-technical users
- Zero additional cost
- Automatic backups and version history
- Easy data export for analysis

### Database Structure

```
Master Spreadsheet: "IIM Mumbai FPL Master Database"
├── Players Tab - Registration and contact info
├── Weekly Scores Tab - Gameweek-by-gameweek scores
├── Weekly Winners Tab - Prize winners and amounts
├── Monthly Winners Tab - Monthly prize calculations
├── Prize Tracking Tab - Payment status and distribution
└── Settings Tab - Configuration parameters
```

### Migration Strategy

**Phase 1** (Current): Google Sheets optimized

- Efficient data structure
- Proper indexing with named ranges
- Error handling for API limits

**Phase 2** (Multi-League): Database migration

- PostgreSQL for relational data integrity
- Redis for caching and session management
- Google Sheets export for stakeholder reporting

### Rationale

Google Sheets provides perfect balance of:

- **Simplicity**: No additional infrastructure
- **Transparency**: Stakeholders can audit financial data
- **Reliability**: Google's infrastructure and backup systems
- **Cost**: Zero additional operating costs
- **Integration**: Native Apps Script database operations

Future migration preserves these benefits while enabling multi-league scale.
