## Pitch

An automated Fantasy Premier League management system that solves the engagement crisis for losing players while eliminating the manual "donkey work" of prize management that typically burns out volunteer administrators.

## The Problem

### Primary Problem: Engagement Crisis

- **Losing Player Dropout**: Players who fall behind in FPL rankings lose motivation and stop participating mid-season
- **Weekly Winner Invisibility**: Small weekly/monthly prizes get lost in overall standings, reducing excitement
- **Lack of Recognition**: Players who excel in specific gameweeks don't get proper acknowledgment

### Secondary Problem: Administrative Burden

- **Manual Prize Calculation**: Volunteers spend hours each week calculating winners and prize distributions
- **Email Management**: Sending personalized updates, standings, and winner announcements manually
- **Payment Tracking**: Managing prize distributions and payment confirmations across dozens of players
- **Data Entry**: Manually updating leaderboards, winner lists, and player statistics

## Our Solution

### Engagement Solution

- **Live Winner Showcase**: Dedicated winner rankings page celebrating all prize winners
- **Multi-Tier Recognition**: Weekly, monthly, and season-end winners with personalized highlights
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live countdown to deadlines and instant leaderboard updates
- **Achievement System**: Player highlights including gameweeks won, total prizes, and ranking achievements

### Automation Solution

- **Automated Prize Calculation**: Daily processing of FPL scores with tie-handling and prize distribution
- **Personalized Email Campaigns**: Automated HTML email templates with individual rankings and winnings
- **Live Data Integration**: Real-time updates from FPL API to website via Google Apps Script backend
