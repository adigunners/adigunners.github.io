# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Console Error Fixes
> Created: 2025-08-29
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix critical console errors preventing proper website functionality and user experience degradation. These errors include missing functions, broken external resource integrity checks, 404 errors for missing assets, and undefined function references that break countdown and QA panel features.

## User Stories

### Website Reliability Enhancement

As a website visitor, I want the site to load without console errors, so that all features work correctly and the browser developer tools don't show warnings.

When users visit the website, they should experience seamless functionality without JavaScript errors interrupting countdown displays, data loading, or interactive features.

### Developer Experience Improvement

As a developer, I want clean console output during development, so that I can focus on real issues rather than noise from missing assets or broken references.

The development workflow should provide clear, actionable feedback without being cluttered by preventable 404 errors or undefined function calls.

## Spec Scope

1. **Font Integrity Validation** - Fix SHA-384 hash validation for Google Fonts Poppins resource
2. **Missing Function Implementation** - Add missing FPLDataLoader.loadWinnerPreview and updateQAPanel functions
3. **Asset 404 Resolution** - Create missing service-worker.js and favicon.ico files
4. **Countdown System Stability** - Ensure countdown fallback mechanisms work without errors
5. **QA Panel Functionality** - Restore admin panel features and debug tools

## Out of Scope

- Complete redesign of modular architecture
- Backend Google Apps Script modifications
- New feature additions beyond error resolution
- Performance optimizations unrelated to console errors

## Expected Deliverable

1. Zero console errors during normal website operation
2. Functional countdown system with proper fallback handling
3. Working QA panel for admin/test modes without undefined function errors
