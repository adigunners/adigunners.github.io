> Spec: Winners Table Rank Classes Bug Fix
> Created: 2025-08-31

## Overview

Fix the broken winners table on winners.html by resolving the missing RANK_CLASSES import that prevents the table from loading and displaying proper top-3 winner formatting. This critical bug completely blocks users from viewing winner rankings with the intended gold/silver/bronze visual distinction.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story

As a **league participant**, I want to **view the complete winner rankings table**, so that **I can see all players ranked by prize money won with proper visual formatting for top 3 winners**.

**Detailed Workflow**: User navigates to winners.html, expects to see a fully-loaded table (desktop â‰¥1025px) or card layout (mobile/tablet) showing all winners ranked by total prize money, with ranks 1-3 displaying distinctive gold, silver, and bronze styling respectively. Currently, the page shows only "Loading..." and fails to render due to undefined RANK_CLASSES reference.

## Spec Scope

1. **Import Fix** - Add missing RANK_CLASSES import to winners-module.js from state-module.js
2. **Table Rendering** - Ensure winners table loads properly with all player data
3. **Top 3 Visual Formatting** - Apply gold/silver/bronze CSS classes to ranks 1, 2, and 3
4. **Responsive Behavior** - Verify table works on desktop and switches to cards on mobile/tablet
5. **Error Resolution** - Eliminate the ReferenceError preventing table initialization

## Out of Scope

- CSS styling modifications (existing styles are correct)
- New visual designs or color schemes
- Performance optimizations beyond the bug fix
- Additional ranking features or sorting options

## Expected Deliverable

1. Winners table loads successfully without console errors
2. Top 3 winners display with distinctive gold, silver, and bronze visual styling
3. Responsive layout works correctly across all device breakpoints
