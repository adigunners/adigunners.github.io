# Backend API

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they
relate to how it should handle backend API interactions in the adigunners.github.io static website
project.

## When to use this skill

- Implementing fetch requests to load JSON data from the `data/` directory on page load
- Managing asynchronous data loading to populate content on `index.html` and `winners.html`
- Handling HTTP headers and CORS considerations when fetching external data sources
- Implementing request/response patterns for loading data into JavaScript modules
- Creating utility functions to abstract API calls and data fetching logic
- Implementing data caching strategies to avoid redundant fetches and improve performance
- Adding request retry logic and timeout handling for reliable data loading in the static site
