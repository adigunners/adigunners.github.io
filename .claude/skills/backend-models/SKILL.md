# Backend Models

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they
relate to how it should handle backend models in the adigunners.github.io static website project.

## When to use this skill

- Defining the structure of objects loaded from JSON data files (e.g., player objects, tournament
  objects)
- Creating JSDoc type annotations or TypeScript-like comments to describe expected data properties
  in JavaScript
- Documenting required vs. optional fields in data objects used by page rendering functions
- Establishing consistent naming conventions for data properties across all JSON files
- Creating validation schemas that enforce correct data structure when loading files
- Defining default values or fallback properties for missing data in loaded objects
- Documenting the relationship between different data models (e.g., how players relate to
  tournaments)
