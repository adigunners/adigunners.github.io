# Global Commenting

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they
relate to how it should handle global commenting in the adigunners.github.io static website project.

## When to use this skill

- Adding comments to JavaScript modules in the `js/` directory to explain complex logic or
  non-obvious functionality
- Documenting function purposes and parameters in vanilla JavaScript code
- Adding clarifying comments to CSS selectors and rules in `css/styles.css` that achieve specific
  visual effects
- Writing header comments in HTML files (`index.html`, `winners.html`) to describe section purposes
  or layout structure
- Ensuring comments in JSON data files (`data/` directory) explain any non-standard data formats or
  conventions
- Reviewing existing comments during refactoring to ensure they remain accurate and aligned with
  current code
- Adding TODO or FIXME comments to mark areas for future improvement in the static site
