# Global Conventions

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they
relate to how it should handle global conventions in the adigunners.github.io static website
project.

## When to use this skill

- Establishing consistent naming conventions for JavaScript functions and variables across different
  modules
- Defining consistent file naming patterns for new components or utilities in the `js/` directory
- Ensuring HTML structure follows consistent patterns across `index.html` and `winners.html`
- Maintaining consistent indentation and formatting in CSS rules and selectors
- Organizing JSON data files in the `data/` directory with consistent property naming and structure
- Defining conventions for CSS class naming (e.g., BEM or other methodologies) and ensuring all
  files follow them
- Setting up consistent module export patterns in vanilla JavaScript to enable code reusability
