# Global Error Handling

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they
relate to how it should handle global error handling in the adigunners.github.io static website
project.

## When to use this skill

- Handling errors when fetching JSON data files from the `data/` directory in JavaScript modules
- Implementing try-catch blocks around DOM manipulation code to prevent silent failures when HTML
  elements are missing
- Adding error handlers to event listeners for user interactions (clicks, form submissions) in the
  static site
- Managing errors that occur during JSON parsing when loading data into the page
- Creating user-friendly error messages when resources fail to load or data is unavailable
- Logging errors to browser console in development while providing graceful fallbacks to users
- Implementing fallback rendering when CSS fails to load or JavaScript modules encounter runtime
  errors
