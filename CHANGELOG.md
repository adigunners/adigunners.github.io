## [Unreleased]

## [2025-01-09] - Winners Page Pagination Implementation

### Added

  - Paginated display showing 10 winners per page
  - Navigation controls with Previous/Next buttons
  - Page information display (e.g., "Page 1 of 5")
  - Automatic pagination controls show/hide based on data volume

### Changed
- **Enhanced `displayWinnerTable()` function**
  - Now supports pagination with proper rank calculation across pages
  - Maintains global ranking regardless of current page
  - Optimizes table column widths dynamically for each page
  - Shows/hides navigation controls based on total pages needed

- **Improved mobile responsiveness**
  - Fixed subtitle text wrapping on mobile devices
  - Removed forced single-line display that caused text cutoff
  - Better text flow for section descriptions on small screens
  - Maintained responsive font sizing while allowing natural text wrapping

- **Updated `loadWinnerData()` function**
  - Stores all winner data globally for pagination
  - Calls pagination-aware display function
  - Preserves existing sorting by total prize won

### Fixed
- **Mobile text display issues**
  - Subtitle "All players ranked by total prize money won this season" now wraps properly

  - Improved readability with proper line-height for wrapped text

- **Table styling consistency**

  - Preserved special background styling for top 3 winners on mobile cards only
  - Maintained clean, consistent rank number display

### Technical Details
- **Pagination Logic**
  - 10 items per page (`winnerItemsPerPage = 10`)
  - Proper calculation of global ranks across pages
  - Navigation buttons disabled/enabled based on current page position
  - Dynamic page info updates (e.g., "Page 2 of 7")

- **Navigation Controls**
  - `previousWinnerPage()` and `nextWinnerPage()` helper functions
  - Smooth page transitions with proper state management
  - Navigation bar hidden when only 1 page of data exists

- **Mobile Optimization**
  - CSS changes to allow natural text wrapping
  - Preserved compact card layout for mobile winner display
  - Dynamic table column width optimization disabled on mobile for better fit

### Performance Improvements
- Efficient pagination reduces DOM complexity for large datasets
- Only renders current page data instead of entire winner list
- Maintains smooth user experience with large winner datasets
