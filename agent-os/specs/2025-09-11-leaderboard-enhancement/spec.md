> Spec: Leaderboard Enhancement - FPL-Style Table Created: 2025-09-11 Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the Overall Leaderboard table to match the visual design and functionality of the official
FPL (Fantasy Premier League) website. The current leaderboard displays basic rank, player name,
prize, and points information, but lacks the rich data presentation and visual cues found in the
official FPL interface.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to see rank movement indicators (up/down arrows) so I can understand how player
  positions have changed between gameweeks
- As a user, I want to see current gameweek points alongside total points so I can understand recent
  performance
- As a user, I want to see the deficit from the leader so I can quickly assess competitive gaps
- As a mobile user, I want the leaderboard to display clearly on my device with appropriate font
  sizing and responsive layout
- As a desktop user, I want a comprehensive 5-column layout that maximizes information density

## Spec Scope

- Replace current 4-column table (Rank, Player, Prize, Points) with new 5-column layout
- Implement rank movement indicators with up/down arrows next to rank numbers
- Add Current GW Points column to show recent gameweek performance
- Replace Prize column with Total Points and Deficit from Leader columns
- Implement responsive design that adapts column visibility and font sizing for mobile devices
- Maintain existing accessibility features (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
- Preserve existing pagination and filtering functionality
- Update table styling to match FPL visual design language

## Out of Scope

- Historical rank tracking data (will use mock movement indicators initially)
- Real-time data synchronization with FPL API
- Advanced sorting functionality beyond existing capabilities
- Export/sharing features
- Player profile integration

## Expected Deliverable

A fully functional enhanced leaderboard table that:

- Displays 5 columns on desktop: Rank (with arrows), Player, Current GW Points, Total Points,
  Deficit from Leader
- Adapts responsively for mobile with appropriate column prioritization
- Maintains performance with existing pagination system
- Passes accessibility audits
- Integrates seamlessly with existing codebase and styling
