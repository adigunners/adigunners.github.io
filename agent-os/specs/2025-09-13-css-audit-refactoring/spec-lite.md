# Spec Summary (Lite)

Conduct comprehensive CSS architecture audit and refactoring to resolve specificity conflicts
between utility classes (like `.leaderboard-gw` vs `.table-align-gw`) and component styles.
Implement consistent BEM naming conventions, consolidate duplicate utility classes, and establish
clear CSS architecture guidelines to prevent future conflicts and ensure maintainable, predictable
styling.
