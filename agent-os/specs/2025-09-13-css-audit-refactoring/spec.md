# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: CSS Architecture Audit and Refactoring Created: 2025-09-13

## Overview

Conduct a comprehensive CSS architecture audit and refactoring to resolve specificity conflicts,
establish consistent naming conventions, and implement a maintainable CSS architecture. This
addresses recent conflicts where utility classes like `.leaderboard-gw` and `.table-align-gw` were
overriding component styles due to specificity issues and inconsistent naming patterns.

## User Stories

### CSS Specificity Resolution

As a developer, I want a clear CSS specificity hierarchy so that component styles are predictable
and utility classes work as intended without unintended overrides.

### Consistent Naming Convention

As a developer, I want standardized CSS class naming conventions so that I can easily understand the
purpose and scope of any CSS class in the codebase.

### Maintainable Architecture

As a developer, I want a well-documented CSS architecture so that future CSS additions follow
established patterns and don't introduce conflicts.

## Spec Scope

1. **CSS Audit Report** - Comprehensive analysis of existing CSS files identifying specificity
   conflicts, naming inconsistencies, and architectural issues
2. **Naming Convention Standardization** - Implementation of BEM methodology or similar consistent
   naming convention across all CSS classes
3. **Specificity Conflict Resolution** - Restructuring CSS to eliminate specificity wars and
   establish clear component vs utility class hierarchy
4. **Utility Class Consolidation** - Consolidation of duplicate utility classes and establishment of
   a consistent utility system
5. **CSS Architecture Documentation** - Creation of CSS style guide and architectural guidelines for
   future development

## Out of Scope

- Visual design changes or UI modifications
- Performance optimizations beyond basic consolidation
- CSS-in-JS migration or framework changes
- Third-party CSS library integration
- Automated CSS tooling setup (PostCSS, Sass, etc.)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **CSS Audit Report** documenting all identified issues, conflicts, and improvement opportunities
2. **Refactored CSS files** with consistent naming conventions, resolved specificity conflicts, and
   consolidated utility classes
3. **CSS Architecture Documentation** including naming conventions, component guidelines, and
   maintenance best practices
4. **Migration Guide** detailing changes made and how to maintain the new CSS architecture
