# Leaderboard Mobile Responsive - Lite Summary

Fix mobile responsiveness issues in the Overall Leaderboard where the rank column misaligns with
other columns and doesn't occupy full row height, while implementing responsive design improvements
for tablet and desktop without affecting data logic or API functionality. The solution focuses on
CSS-only changes to ensure proper column alignment, adequate touch targets (≥48px height), and zero
horizontal scrolling on mobile devices ≤700px width.
