# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Leaderboard Mobile Responsive Created: 2025-09-22 Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix mobile responsiveness issues in the Overall Leaderboard where the rank column misaligns with
other columns and doesn't occupy full row height, while implementing responsive design improvements
for tablet and desktop without affecting data logic or API functionality.

## User Stories

### Mobile User Story

As a fantasy league participant using a mobile device, I want the leaderboard to display properly
with aligned columns and adequate touch targets, so that I can easily view rankings and tap on rows
without horizontal scrolling or layout issues.

The mobile user opens the leaderboard on their phone (≤700px width) and sees a properly formatted
table where the rank column (number + movement icon) is centered and spans the full cell width,
vertically centered within a minimum 48-56px row height. Player names truncate with ellipsis,
numeric columns remain right-aligned, and the sticky "After GWx" header stays visible without
overlapping.

### Tablet/Desktop User Story

As a fantasy league participant using a tablet or desktop, I want enhanced visual polish with proper
column alignment and hover states, so that I can quickly scan through rankings with improved
readability and consistent layout.

The user accesses the leaderboard on larger screens and experiences improved numeric column
alignment, consistent column widths, optional row hover states, and potential zebra striping for
enhanced readability while maintaining all existing functionality.

### Accessibility User Story

As a user with accessibility needs, I want the leaderboard to maintain semantic table structure with
proper touch targets and screen reader support, so that I can navigate the rankings effectively
regardless of my interaction method.

The user navigates the leaderboard using assistive technology and finds proper table semantics
(thead, th scope attributes), adequate touch targets (≥44px), and meaningful aria-labels for
movement indicators that convey rank changes through screen reader announcements.

## Spec Scope

1. **Mobile Rank Column Fix** - Fix rank column alignment and ensure it spans full cell width with
   centered content on mobile devices (≤700px)
2. **Touch Target Optimization** - Implement minimum 48-56px row heights on mobile to ensure
   adequate touch targets for tapping
3. **Responsive Header Alignment** - Fix header cell alignment to match body cell styling,
   particularly for the rank column
4. **Tablet/Desktop Polish** - Add visual enhancements like hover states, zebra striping, and
   improved column alignment for larger screens
5. **Accessibility Improvements** - Maintain semantic table structure and add proper ARIA labels for
   movement indicators

## Out of Scope

- API changes or modifications to data fetching logic
- Sorting and pagination functionality changes
- "After GWx" copy or logic modifications
- Complete layout restructuring to card-based design
- Performance optimizations beyond CSS-only changes

## Expected Deliverable

1. Mobile leaderboard displays without horizontal scrolling on devices ≤700px width with properly
   aligned rank column and minimum 52px row heights
2. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) score below 0.01 during leaderboard render with no visual
   regressions on tablet/desktop layouts
3. All touch targets meet 44px minimum height requirement on mobile with proper semantic table
   structure and screen reader support for rank movement indicators
