# Spec Summary (Lite)

Redesign the Fantasy League navigation with a mobile-first 5-6 tab ribbon (Dashboard, Winners &
Payouts, Leaderboard, Gameweek Hub, Awards & Records) that consolidates features into focused hubs.
Add localStorage-based personalization (FPL ID â†’ "Your rank") and create reusable UI components
(chips, filters, cards, tables) to support daily engagement and scalable feature growth, all within
the current static HTML + vanilla JS stack.
